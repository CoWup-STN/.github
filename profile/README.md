# CoWup - Coastal waters under pressure - a Strategic Research Council funded project

Coastal waters, facing a wide range of environmental and geopolitical challenges, are important providers of economic and social benefits to coastal communities. Protecting the marine environment and ensuring the sustainable use of marine resources are crucial for restoring and maintaining the health of coastal waters. The project aims to identify, analyse, and quantify risks to the marine environment in the Gulf of Finland, especially in the current geopolitical context where Russia's war against Ukraine has ceased cooperation with Russia and raised new risks to the marine environment. In collaboration with key stakeholders, we will create scenarios encompassing a range of environmental risks and analyse the identified risks. We will develop methods and tools to assess the impacts of adverse events on the marine environment, taking into account the associated uncertainties. This information will be vital in formulating relevant policies for risk management and mitigation practices.
